//CLASS INTERFACES:

/*
 This class allows to easily create OpenGL 2D textures from images, text or raw data.
 The created Texture2D object will always have power-of-two dimensions.
 Depending on how you create the Texture2D object, the actual image area of the texture might be smaller than the texture dimensions i.e. "contentSize" != (pixelsWide, pixelsHigh) and (maxS, maxT) != (1.0, 1.0).
 Be aware that the content of the generated textures will be upside-down!
